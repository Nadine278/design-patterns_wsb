# Abstract Factory Pattern {DP3.PY}

This allows you to create connected object families without having to declare their concrete classes. 
We have the simplest techniques to make a comparable kind of multiple objects using the abstract factory approach.
It allows you to encapsulate a collection of individual factories. 
Essentially, we're attempting to abstract the development of objects based on logic, business, platform selection, and so on.

for example we are in a restaurant and we need to order different type of food form diffent kind may vegan food or other fruits.
thats the example i tried to give.

# Adapter Method â€“  Design Patterns {DP2.PY}

It assists us in adjusting incompatible objects to one another. 
The Adapter approach is one of the easiest to understand because there are so many real-life instances to illustrate the similarity. 
This method's main goal is to build a link between two incompatible interfaces. 
This method gives a class an alternative interface. We can better comprehend the concept.

for example here, i did the English and polish transulator. this will translulate words and vice versa.
It converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 

# observer pattern - {Oberver parttern.py }

The observer pattern is a behavioral interface that allows some elements to tell other objects when their state changes.
For every object that defines an user interface, the Observer pattern provides a method to subscribe to and unsubscribe from these events.

 for example i gave codes to All "view" behavior should be assigned to decoupled and unique Observer objects that register with the Subject.
 It conforms to the loose coupling principle between items that interact with one another, 
 allowing data to be sent to other objects without requiring any changes to the Subject or Observer classes.
 Observers can be added or revoked at any time.
